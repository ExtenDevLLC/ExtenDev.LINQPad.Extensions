# ExtenDev.LINQPad.Extensions

## Initial Commit

These extensions are mostly an accumulation of ad-hoc scripting needs and various experiments over many years of [LINQPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) use. They have not necessarily been held to the same code quality standards and practices that might be expected of production code. There is little in the way of documentation, but this repository was created in an effort to share them with others a little easier and simplify the process of keeping various environments up-to-date. Hopefully, with time, the documentation, quality, and coding standards will improve.
